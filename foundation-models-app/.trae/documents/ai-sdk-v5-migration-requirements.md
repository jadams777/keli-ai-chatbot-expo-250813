# AI SDK v5 Migration and Apple Foundation Models Integration - Product Requirements

## 1. Product Overview

This document outlines the requirements for migrating an existing Expo iOS application from a custom `expo-foundation-models` implementation to Vercel AI SDK v5 with integrated Apple Foundation Models support. The migration will modernize the AI integration architecture while adding on-device Apple Intelligence capabilities for enhanced privacy and performance.

The project consists of an Expo React Native iOS app with a custom native module for Apple Foundation Models, which needs to be replaced with the standardized AI SDK v5 and `@react-native-ai/apple` provider. This migration will provide better maintainability, feature parity with modern AI SDK capabilities, and seamless integration with both local and cloud-based AI models.

## 2. Core Features

### 2.1 User Roles

| Role | Registration Method | Core Permissions |
|------|---------------------|------------------|
| iOS App User | Device-based access | Can use all AI features including on-device Apple Intelligence |
| Developer | Development environment | Can configure and test both local and cloud AI providers |

### 2.2 Feature Module

Our migration requirements consist of the following main components:

1. **Migration Documentation**: Comprehensive step-by-step migration guide, API mapping, and troubleshooting.
2. **Technical Architecture**: Updated system design with AI SDK v5 integration and Apple Foundation Models.
3. **Implementation Examples**: Code samples for both Expo app and Next.js API server integration.
4. **Testing Strategy**: Validation approach for ensuring feature parity during migration.

## 3. Core Process

**Migration Flow:**
Developers will follow a systematic migration process starting with dependency updates, followed by code migration using automated codemods where possible, manual API updates, testing, and finally deployment verification.

**Implementation Flow:**
The new architecture will first attempt to use Apple Foundation Models for on-device processing, with automatic fallback to cloud providers through the Next.js API server when Apple Intelligence is unavailable or insufficient for the task.
